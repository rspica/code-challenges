# code-challenges

This is a personal repo that holds code challenges pulled from various sources and solved using javascript
The repo is set-up as a study aid for understanding concepts and logic in programming. Although these challeges are solve in JS they can be solved with any language. 

Feel free to contribute by adding to the chalenge base, the solutions base within each challenge, or with general comments. *The only rule:* all contributors please be respectful.


## Repo structure
the repo struct is set-up with three folders *easy | medium | hard,* each reflect level of difficulty. Within each folder are individual code challenges. The "filename".js is set up with the challenge listed at the top and the solution coded out below. In some cases I have tried to solve the challenge in multiple ways. 

Some challenge solutions are eligent while others no so (down right embarassingly rude, but all should work). Before laughing too hard, keep in mind that this is designed as a study aid to further my knowledge of Javascript. I consider myself a newbie.
